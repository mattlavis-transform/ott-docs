# Trade Tariff Public API v1

The Trade Tariff Public API provides a simple and consistent way to request
[UK Trade Tariff](https://gov.uk/trade-tariff) content as structured data in a predictable format.

From January 1st 2021, the API will also provide data on the EU Tariff as applies to certain
trades with Northern Ireland (known as the XI Tariff).

This API accepts HTTP requests and responds with
[JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) data containing the same
published content as is presented on GOV.UK.


## Base URLs
The base URLs below may be used for accessing the UK and the EU Tariff for Northern Ireland (XI) respectively. Further examples in this 
document only show the UK version of the API.
